Hi!

Some of the assignments seems to have the same or similar names and this probably happened when I was trying to be fancy with header files and moving functions around! I am pretty sure that the last digit of number(version 1 and 2) have several of the smaller assignments packed into the same file.

Sorry for the inconvenience!

Cheers!
Daniel
